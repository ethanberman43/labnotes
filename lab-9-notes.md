#Lab 9 Notes
###Version Control

Goal: to solve problem of multiplicity of versions

New Version control system: Git
- every time you sit down and do something, you record your actions in a journal (called Git)
- unless you save each individual change, you will only have the latest version, you lose history
- to solve this problem, you add the journal layer which documents each change
- combines individual changes into versions, which are converted into the journal  

git init: sets up this structure, keep track of that folder  

git add: package certain changes  

git commit: saves versions  

git push: synchronizes journal to some remote server  

git pull: takes things from server and pulls them back  

git status: do after EVERYTHING, what is Git doing? 

git checkout: removes modifications if not pushed to server yet
