#Lab 10 Notes
##Versioning and Git Continued  


2 models of working with Github:
###Model 1
- 3 collaborates pushing/pulling from remote
- permission granted to those 3 to write into repository
- works great for very small teams, more or less the model of google docs  
  
###Model 2
- model 1 doesn't really work with thousands of lines of code and many people editing due to loss of versions
- at some point, you can branch the versions
- multiple remotes and many local users
- local users create changes then submit "pull requests" and other users accept or deny changes after review
