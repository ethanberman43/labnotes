#Lab 5 Notes  

When you delete applications:  
- Cannot just delete, must uninstall. Some program must come in and search through the application and decide what is still needed and what is not longer needed  
- ex: firefox and word may be using the same file, so when uninstalling firefox must keep said file but delete others.


Mac does not provide central repository system, but there is an unoffical one called "brew"
- brew includes commands such as "wget"
- repository acts as a central library and vets out programs to make sure that they are safe and not a hacker


head (command): will show you the first few lines of the file  
tail (command): will show you the last lines of the file  
wget (command): will down file from the internet if you put link in 

###Search Commands  
- locate: good way to find files. Not working on mac until you load the database, not working for me. * means anything. ex: test*** means file names test with 3 unknown variables after it
